In this project, a web-based library system has been developed that emulates the services of a traditional library. The main objective of the system is to allow users to rent books and receive them in PDF format, providing a convenient and accessible experience from anywhere. Additionally, an administration panel has been implemented to allow administrators to create categories and manage the available books on the platform.

Project Architecture:
The project has been developed following a client-server architecture. On the back-end side, Spring Boot, a Java framework for web application development, has been used. Spring Boot offers a wide range of features and tools that facilitate the creation of robust and scalable applications. On the front-end side, React, a JavaScript library for building interactive user interfaces, has been utilized.

System Functionality:
2.1 User Registration:
Users can register in the system by providing their basic information, such as name, email address, and password. Security measures have been implemented to ensure the integrity of user data.

2.2 Book Search and Display:
Users can browse the catalog of books available on the platform. They can perform searches by title, author, or category, making it easier to locate specific books. Furthermore, detailed information about each book is displayed, including its description, author, and availability.

2.3 Book Rental:
Users can select an available book and rent it for a specific period of time. When renting a book, a PDF file is generated and sent to the user's email address. This file contains the complete content of the book and can be accessed from any device with a PDF reader.

2.4 Book Return:
Once users have finished reading a book, they can mark it as "returned" in their profile. This indicates that the book is available again for rental by other users.

Administration Panel:
3.1 Category Creation:
Administrators have the ability to create new categories to classify books on the platform. This allows for better organization and easier navigation for users.
3.2 Book Management:
Administrators can add new books to the platform, providing information such as title, author, description, and category. They also have the ability to edit existing book information and delete books from the catalog when necessary.

Conclusions:
This online library system project has demonstrated the ability to utilize Spring Boot and Java on the back-end side, and React on the front-end side, to create a functional and high-quality web application. Users can enjoy the experience of renting books in PDF format, while administrators have the capability to efficiently manage categories and available books.
The development of this project has allowed for learning about the mentioned technologies, as well as the importance of security and usability in web application design. It is expected that this system can be further improved and expanded in the future, providing an even more enriching experience for users and administrators of the online library platform.
